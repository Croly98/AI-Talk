I've created a professional unified pipeline (pipeline.html) that
  combines STT - OpenAI - TTS in a single interface:

  Key Features:
  - One-button operation: Single "Talk to AI" button handles the entire
  flow
  - Professional UI: Clean, modern design with gradient background
  - Real-time status: Visual feedback for listening/processing/speaking
  states
  - Conversation history: Shows the dialogue between you and AI
  - Simple configuration: Enter your Azure Speech and OpenAI keys once

  How it works:
  1. Click "Talk to AI" button
  2. Speak your question (status shows "Listening...")
  3. AI processes your speech and generates response (status shows "AI is
  thinking...")
  4. AI response is spoken back to you (status shows "Speaking...")
  5. Conversation appears in the history panel
  6. Button re-enables for next interaction

  To use:
  1. Fill in your Azure Speech Services key and region
  2. Add your OpenAI API key
  3. Open in a local server (e.g. Live Server in VS Code)
  4. Click the talk button and speak

  The pipeline maintains conversation context and uses GPT-3.5-turbo for
  fast responses. The interface handles errors gracefully and provides
  clear status updates throughout the process.
